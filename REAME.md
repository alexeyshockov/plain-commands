# Symfony Annotated Commands

Create CLI applications with many commands easily. This library is a lightweight wrapper around Symfony Console 
Component, that can be used alone or within Symfony based web application.

## Alternatives

* https://github.com/consolidation/annotated-command — similar approach, but from a different angle

## TODO

* Support Command::interact() somehow?
